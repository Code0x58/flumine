import betfairlightweight
from flumine import Flumine, clients

trading = betfairlightweight.APIClient("username")
client = clients.BetfairClient(trading)

framework = Flumine(
    client=client,
)
```

from betfairlightweight.filters import streaming_market_filter


class ExampleStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def start(self):
        # subscribe to streams
        print("starting strategy 'ExampleStrategy'")
        
    def check_market_book(self, market_book):
        # process_market_book only executed if this returns True
        if market_book.status != "CLOSED":
            return True

    def process_market_book(self, market_book):
        # process marketBook object
        print(market_book.status)


strategy = ExampleStrategy(
    market_filter=streaming_market_filter(
        event_type_ids=["7"],
        country_codes=["GB"],
        market_types=["WIN"],
    )
)

framework.add_strategy(strategy)
```

Run framework:

```python

!!! danger
    By default flumine will try and prevent coding errors which result in [flash crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crash) and [burnt fingers](https://www.betangel.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2458) but use at your own risk as per the MIT license.
    
    Recommendation is not to remove the [trading controls](/advanced) and carry out extensive testing before executing on live markets, even then only use new strategies on an account with a small balance (transfer balance to games wallet).

## Features

- Streaming
- Multiple strategies
- Order execution (in development)
- Paper trading (in development)
- Back testing (in development)
- Analytics (in development)
